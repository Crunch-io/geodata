# Nordic Adminstrative Units

This archive contains shapefile, GeoJSON, and TopoJSON files of nordic adminstrative boundaries, created for displaying survey data at the 1:10 million scale. This data is a mixture of level 0, level 2, and level 3 adminstrative boundaries because said boudnaries are unique to survey frameworks and do not follow official EU NUT (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) classification. However, when possible NUT field values were maintained within the datasets.  

## Data
All data was downloaded from the European commission Eurostat repository and further edited within QGIS to match survey frameworks. Final data were saved as geoJSON's within QGIS and converted to topoJSON using the R package geojsonio. Data is organised by datatype, while naming convention reflects the geographic location. Zipped shapefiles are included for editing purpose, while GeoJSON and TopoJson files are included for prefrence. All data are projected in EPSG: 3035 ETRS89 / LAEA Europe.
